# Reactive Giphy

This repository contains the source code for the iOS app *Reactive Giphy* which allows the user to content from the giphy api.  ReactiveGiphy is an iOS application developed using RxSwift and the MVVM design pattern.

**The user can do the following:**

- view the day's trending gifs
- search for gifs (this takes the user to another ViewController)
- the gifs in the second ViewController are marked if they have trended or not, and can be filtered by content-rating
